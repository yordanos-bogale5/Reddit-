# 🛡️ Anti-Detection System Guide

## Overview

The Anti-Detection System is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help Discord server promotion bypass subreddit rules and avoid post removal. This system specifically targets Norwegian NSFW subreddits like `r/norwaygonewildddddddd` but can be adapted for other communities.

## 🚨 Problem Solved

Your Discord promotion post was removed because it violated **Rule #8: "Do not mention other sites or apps (OF, Fansly, discord etc)"**. Our anti-detection system solves this by:

1. **URL Obfuscation**: Hide Discord links using shortened URLs and redirect chains
2. **Content Variation**: Generate compliant content that doesn't trigger filters
3. **Rule Compliance**: Automatically check content against subreddit rules
4. **Image-Based Promotion**: Embed QR codes in attractive images
5. **Stealth Strategies**: Advanced posting techniques to avoid detection

## 🔧 Features

### 1. Smart URL Management (`/anti-detection/shorten-url`)

**Purpose**: Hide Discord links from automated detection

**Features**:
- Multiple URL shortening services (TinyURL, Dagd, OSDB)
- Redirect chain creation (double obfuscation)
- Service rotation to avoid patterns
- Click tracking and analytics
- Custom domain support

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/anti-detection/shorten-url" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://discord.gg/Norskedamerr",
    "create_redirect_chain": true
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "original_url": "https://discord.gg/Norskedamerr",
    "final_url": "https://tinyurl.com/abc123",
    "chain_length": 2
  }
}
```

### 2. Content Variation Engine (`/anti-detection/generate-content`)

**Purpose**: Generate compliant Norwegian NSFW content with hidden promotion

**Strategies**:
- `comment_only`: Clean post + delayed comment with link
- `bio_redirect`: "Link in bio" approach
- `coded_message`: Coded DM instructions
- `image_qr`: QR code embedded in image
- `comment_chain`: Build engagement then add link

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/anti-detection/generate-content" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "discord_url": "https://discord.gg/Norskedamerr",
    "strategy": "comment_only"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "title": "Norsk jente søker selsskap 🇳🇴",
    "body": "Hei! Jeg er en 24 år gammel norsk jente som søker hyggelige folk å snakke med. Liker musikk og film. Send meg en melding! 😊",
    "strategy": "comment_only",
    "comment_instructions": {
      "delay_minutes": 8,
      "comment_text": "Hei! For de som vil chatte mer privat: https://tinyurl.com/abc123 😊"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Rule Compliance Checker (`/anti-detection/check-compliance`)

**Checks**:
- ✅ No banned terms (discord, onlyfans, etc.)
- ✅ Norwegian/Swedish/Danish language
- ✅ No buying/selling language

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/anti-detection/check-compliance" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Join my Discord server!",
    "body": "Come chat with us on Discord!",
    "subreddit": "norwaygonewildddddddd"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "is_compliant": false,
    "compliance_score": 25,
    "violations": [
      {
        "rule": "no_external_sites",
        "violation": "Contains banned term: 'discord'",
        "severity": "high"
      }
    ],
    "suggested_fixes": [
      {

      }
    ]
  }
