# üöÄ Reddit Actions Testing Guide

## Quick Start for Live Reddit Testing

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
# Option 1: Use the quick start script
python start_server.py

# Option 2: Manual start
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 2. Access the Test Interface

- **Test Form**: http://localhost:8000/test-form
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/

### 3. Setup Reddit Account Connection

Before testing, you need to connect a Reddit account:

#### Option A: Use API Endpoints (Recommended)
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Use the `/accounts/connect` endpoint to connect your Reddit account
3. Provide your Reddit refresh token

#### Option B: Direct Database Insert (if needed)
If you already have a refresh token, you can add it directly to the database.

### 4. Test Reddit Actions

1. Open http://localhost:8000/test-form
2. Click "Load Connected Accounts" to see available accounts
3. Fill in the post form:

   - **Subreddit**: Use `test` or any subreddit you have access to
   - **Title**: "Test post from automation dashboard"
   - **Body**: "This is a test post from my Reddit automation dashboard."
   - **URL**: Leave empty for text post, or add URL for link post
4. Click "Submit Post"
5. Check the response for success/failure and permalink

#### üí¨ Submit a Comment

2. Fill in the comment form:
   - **Account**: Select your connected account
   - **Parent Post ID**: The post ID you copied
   - **Comment Text**: "This is a test comment from my automation dashboard."
   - **Subreddit**: Optional, for logging purposes
3. Click "Submit Comment"
4. Check the response for success/failure and permalink

### 5. API Endpoints Available

#### Reddit Actions
- `GET /reddit/accounts` - List connected accounts
- `POST /reddit/submit-post` - Submit a post
- `POST /reddit/submit-comment` - Submit a comment
- `GET /reddit/test-account/{account_id}` - Test account connection

#### Example API Calls

**Submit Post:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/reddit/submit-post" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": 1,
    "subreddit": "test",
    "title": "Test post from API",
    "body": "This is a test post submitted via API"
  }'
```

**Submit Comment:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/reddit/submit-comment" \

  -d '{
    "account_id": 1,
    "parent_post_id": "abc123",
    "comment_text": "Test comment from API"
  }'
```

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **"Account not found"**
   - Make sure you've connected a Reddit account first
   - Check the account ID is correct

2. **"Account not connected to Reddit"**
   - The account doesn't have a valid refresh token
   - Re-connect the account using OAuth2 flow

3. **"Reddit API error"**
   - Check your Reddit API credentials in .env file
   - Ensure the refresh token is still valid
   - Check if you have permission to post in the subreddit

4. **"Failed to submit post/comment"**
   - Check Reddit's posting rules for the subreddit
   - Ensure you're not rate limited
   - Verify the post ID is correct for comments

#### Environment Setup:

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_app_name/1.0
```

### 7. Success Indicators
